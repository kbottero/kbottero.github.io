## Who am I ?

Hi, I am Kevin Bottero.<br />
<br />
As a Fresh French Front Developer, I am mainly involved in React + Redux projects.<br />
You can easily find me in MeetUps around Paris.<br />
<br />
Power napping and early rising are my secret weapons.<br />
<br />
I love to read about psychology, sociology and way too much self-improvement stuff.<br />
Space conquest is my nerdy weak point.<br />
